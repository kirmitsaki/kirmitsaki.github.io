                  <h5 class="my-4 mt-4">About the project</h5>
                  <p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif">Currently, the veterinary relationship is structured around the vet, not the owner. Each vet starts and maintains individual relationships with key suppliers, taking time and resource away from patient care. Meanwhile, the pet owner has to independently manage relationships with insurers, specialists and wellbeing services for their pets. All data exists in silos.</p>
                  <p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif">PawSquad builds entirely on restructuring the veterinary relationship to revolve around the pet owner, not the vet: A customer centric platform that redefines veterinary care.</p>
                  <p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif">By having one point of contact, the home visit vet, services can be pulled in as needed to support that relationship. Meanwhile, we manage the supplier relationships on behalf of our vets, giving them more time to focus on care - and creating greater efficiency, reduced costs, and scalability for us as an organisation.</p>
                  <p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif">The challenge is to develop a service that has true value for the end user is to keep pace with the ever-changing market reality that affects the veterinary industry and shapes the user's behaviour.</p>

                  <h5 class="my-4 mt-4">Audience</h5>

                  <h5 class="my-4 mt-4">Challenges</h5>
                  <p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif"><span class="fw-bolder">Accelerating Customer Acquisition -</span> We are currently trying to understand what acquisition channels are the best ones to employ when launching in a new area. Although we have ardent fans, we believe we face the following barriers to acquisition at scale:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif"><span class="fw-bolder">Point of Need -</span> the sales cycle is long, and many pet owners we reach will not have a need to see a vet right now. We are working on ways of capturing interest even if a user does not book straight away.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif"><span class="fw-bolder">Trust & Credibility -</span> whilst we have a very credible team, including our vets and advisors, we have not communicated this well enough. We're tackling this through a site redesign, a new social media strategy, and veterinary content creation.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif"><span class="fw-bolder">Reluctance to Switch -</span> we believe we're currently accessing 2 out of 3 possible customer segments: 1) those who currently don't have a vet and 2) those with little loyalty to their vet. The remaining, very large, segment will need a better incentive to switch over to PawSquad.</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  <p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif"><span class="fw-bolder">Correct Attribution -</span> we believe the conversion path includes discovery through Facebook advertising or offline campaigns and conversion via Adwords or Direct traffic. This makes it difficult to accurately understand the return on investment on different channels. We're working on both our tracking and building a comprehensive attribution model.</p>

                  <h5 class="my-4 mt-4">Steps to improve</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">Better, more personalised CRM - with the aim to increase activation and retention</p></li>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">Referral programme - incentivised referrals that gives £12 of credit towards next consultation for both existing and new customer</p></li>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">Welcome pack - a CRM tool that our vets give to new customers upon the first consult, and which includes referral cards for customers to give to friends</p></li>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">Local PR - supporting the media and online advertising buys with press coverage will improve their performance</p></li>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">Subscription: Offering a comprehensive plan for your annual pet care is a good way to draw people in, increase loyalty and MRR</p></li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <h5 class="my-4 mt-4">Marketing strategy</h5>
                  <ul>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">To expand our home visit business, we employ a hyperlocal marketing approach that consists of a launch campaign in each new area of operation. We provide launch marketing for 2-3 months, until the vet reaches capacity of 250 pets signed up, and then we reduce localised support considerably.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">Our strategy on a local level is a mix of online and offline, with a focus on being visible on the ground and helping to build relationships and trust in the brand in a way that suits the location.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">To do this we mix offline media buys such as billboards, car wraps, digital billboards, local newspaper ads, and street flyering with offline activity such as finding dog boarders, walkers, pet shops, and other partners who want to spread the word about PawSquad.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">We pair this offline strategy with local online advertising on Facebook and Google that drives targeted traffic to book an appointment online or over the phone. Facebook is used to drive enthusiasm about the launch and concept around the time of launch, and Adwords to drive bookings during the first 2-3 months.</p></li>
                    <li><p class="font-sans-serif">Our video/text consultations are marketed through our partners, and accessible for anyone visiting the site.</p></li>

                  <h5 class="my-4 mt-4">Branding strategy</h5>
                  <p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif">As we're learning more and more about what our customers want, and receive increasing amounts of data from our online marketing efforts, we're refining our brand strategy and positioning.</p>
                  <p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif">Whilst our brand strategy has always been to appear new, innovative and a lot friendlier than most other veterinary businesses, we have recalibrated the balance between 'friendly' and 'trustworthy'. While our advertising campaigns in local areas can be eye-catching and 'different', our website presence will soon reflect a more restrained, formal look aimed at reflecting the high level of veterinary experience and service our vets offer. </p>
                  <p class="mt-4 font-sans-serif">User tests also revealed missing information needed by visitors to make the decision to book an appointment - all of which are being addressed in the new design.</p>
